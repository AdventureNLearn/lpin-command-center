# Grok's Eye View

A meme spy-satellite cockpit over a real 3D Earth. Live aircraft, modeled ships,
satellites, quakes, fires, launches. The data is public. Grok is just being
dramatic about it.

**Inspired by [Bilawal Sidhu](https://github.com/bilawalsidhu)’s
[God's Eye View](https://github.com/bilawalsidhu/gods-eye-view)** (MIT).
The original is the source of the idea and the feeling. This is a separate web
recreation with a Grok-shaped personality, not a copy of that source tree.
If you like the concept, go star his project.

> Public data · not for navigation.

## Try it

- First look: **Planes, please**, **Space junk**, **The planet is yelling**, or just the globe
- Drag to orbit, scroll to zoom, click a contact to lock it
- **Cockpit** = you are the plane now · **D** detection boxes · **1–6** optical / CRT / NVG / FLIR / Noir / Snow
- Command bar: `yo tokyo`, `find a plane`, `night vision`, `put on creedence`
- **G** opens Grok comms — ask about a contact, a city, or the view
- **R** opens the tuner — Creedence internet radio, plus add your own station
- Share copies the camera for the group chat

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Cesium assets are copied from `node_modules/cesium` at dev/build time. No
Google 3D tiles, no accounts, no database.

## Stand this up (KIT-08)

Remix this cockpit, or clone and `npm install && npm run dev`. Civic data is
vendored (Kept harvests + permit catalog). Kit paste is FEATURE_KITS +
GROK_BUILD_HANDOFF in the unification pack. Home Screen: open on iPhone/iPad
with `?install=1&platform=ios`. Live gevradio is a frozen reference — this
tree is a new app. No secrets in this file.

Optional: `XAI_API_KEY` on the server lets Grok comms answer questions about
the globe, and lets the command bar parse free-form language. Local parsers
and the radio still work without it.
